    "### Kinematic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1. Sketch the robot arm in its zero configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Label joints from 1 to n\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define joint axes\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Label links from 0 to n\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define common normals and reference frame origins\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Add gripper frame: it's an extra frame, represents the point on the end effector that we actually care about. It differs from frame 6 only by a translation in z6 direction.\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2. Derive DH parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image11]\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions of the four DH parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **α** (twist angle): the angle between **Zi-1** and **Zi** measured about **Xi-1** in a right hand sense.\n",
    "* **a** (link length): the distance from **Zi-1** to **Zi** measred along **Xi-1** where **Xi-1** is perpendicular to both.\n",
    "* **d** (link offset): the signed distance from **Xi-1** to **Xi** measured along **Zi**.\n",
    "* **θ** (joint angle): the angle between **Xi-1** and **Xi** measured about **Zi** in a right hand sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "I first identified the location of each non-zero link lengths **a** and the link offsets **d**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "\n",
    "I obtained the values for **a** and **d** from the URDF file at `/kuka_arm/urdf/kr210.urdf.xacro`. It wasn't a straight forward task because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The joint origin in the URDF file are not consistent with the frame origins created in accordance with the DH parameter convention, nor do they have the same orientation:\n",
    "![alt text][image7]\n",
    "2. Each joint is defined relative to its parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I obtained th twist angles **alpha** from observing the relationship of each **Zi-1** and **Zi** pair:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z(i), Z(i+1) | α(i) \n",
    "--- | ---\n",
    "Z(0) ll Z(1) | 0\n",
    "Z(1) ⟂ Z(2)| -pi/2\n",
    "Z(2) ll Z(3) | 0 \n",
    "Z(3) ⟂ Z(4) | -pi/2\n",
    "Z(4) ⟂ Z(5) | pi/2\n",
    "Z(5) ⟂ Z(6) | -pi/2\n",
    "Z(6) ll Z(G) | 0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the DH parameter table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Links | α(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i-1) | θ(i)\n",
    "--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n",
    "0->1 | 0 | 0 | 0.75 | q1\n",
    "1->2 | -pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | q2 - pi/2\n",
    "2->3 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | q3\n",
    "3->4 |  -pi/2 | -0.054 | 1.50 | q4\n",
    "4->5 | pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q5\n",
    "5->6 | -pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q6\n",
    "6->EE | 0 | 0 | 0.303 | q7\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Using the DH parameter table to create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each link there are four individual transforms, 2 rotations and 2 translations:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image8]\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix form this transform is:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image9]\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to individual transforms, I determined the transfromation between `base_link` and the `end_effector` by pre-multiplying(intrinsic transformations) all individual transforms together:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image10]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I determined a complete homogeneous transfrom between `base_link` and the `gripper_link` using the end-effector pose (position + rotation):\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image12]\n",
    "\n",
    "where Px, Py, Pz represent the position of end-effector w.r.t. base_link and RT represent the rotation part. I constructed RT using the Roll-Pitch-Yaw angles of the end-effector (given by the simulator).\n",
    "\n",
    "The URDF model does not follow the DH convention, I used additional rotations - a rotation about z-axis of 180° followed by a rotation about the y-axis of -90° - in the calculation to compensate for the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image13]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last three joints of the robot are revolute and their joint axes intersect at a single point at `joint_5` - it's a **spherical wrist** with `joint_5` being its **wrist center**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I kinematically decoupled the IK problem into two steps: **Inverse Position** and **Inverse Orientation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inverse Position\n",
    "The goal of this step is to find the first 3 joint angles using the end effector's position in Cartesian coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **spherical wrist** involving `joints 4,5,6`, the position of the **wrist center** is governed by the first three joints. I used the complete transformation matrix derived above to find the position of the **wrist center**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image14]\n",
    "\n",
    "where Px, Py, Pz represent the position of end-effector w.r.t. base_link and d represents the displacement between **wrist center** and **gripper** along the z-axis, which is **dG** in the graph below and the values are defined in the URDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I have the **wrist center** position, I used trigonometry to find the values for the first three joint angles. **theta1** is straightforward by looking from above to the robotic arm:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image15]\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram depicts **theta2** and **theta3**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image16]\n",
    "\n",
    "From the DH parameters I calculated the distance between each joint and then used Cosine Laws to calculate **theta2** and **theta3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inverse Orientation\n",
    "The goal is to find the values of the final three joint angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the values of the first joint angles obtained above, I calculated **R0_3** via the application of homogeneous transformations up to the WC. Then I find the rotation matrix between joint 3 and joint 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image17]\n",
    "\n",
    "where **R0_6** is the homogeneous RPY rotation matrix calculated above from the `base_link` to `gripper_link`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**R3_6** is the rotation matrix of the extrinsic X-Y-Z rotation sequence account for the end gripper from the wrist center::\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image18]\n",
    "\n",
    "where **R_XYZ** is **R3_6**, and **alpha**, **beta**, **gamma** is **theta4**, **theta5**, **theta6**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the formulas I used to calculate the last three angles:\n",

    "### Project Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented Forward Kinematics in lines 60 to 91 in `IK_server.py`, and Inverse Kinematics in lines 121 to 160.\n",
